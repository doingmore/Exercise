 Welcome! 
This directory is little different, because the tasks from this level 
are with specific instruction. Working with multiple files and skeletons(from SoftUni).
Every task is in different project file. Here you will discover for every task instruction in the general directory for relevant topic.
File with instructions for problems are ".docx".
I went through it the whole course many times. For each period, the solutions to the problems are in different folders.
