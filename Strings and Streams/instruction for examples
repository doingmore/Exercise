Strings and Streams – Homework Exercises
Write C++ code for solving the tasks on the following pages.
Code should compile under the C++03 or the C++11 standard.
Please submit a single.cpp file for each task.
.cpp files for the tasks should be named with the task number followed by what you feel describes the exercise in a few words.
E.g. a good name for task 2 of this homework would be:
2.mathematical-expression.cpp
Don’t worry about the name too much, just make sure the number and the file extension are correct.

Problem 1 – Compare Arrays Again
Write a program that reads two integer arrays from the console and compares them element by element. For better code reusability, you could do the comparison in a function, which returns true if they are equal and false if not.
Each array will be defined by a single line on the console, containing the numbers in the array, separated by spaces.
Print equal if the arrays match, and not equal if the arrays don’t match.
Examples
Input	Output
1 2 3
1 2 3	equal
1 2 3
2 1 3	not equal
10 1
42 13 69	not equal

========================================================================

Problem 2 – Mathematical Expression
Write a program that reads a line from the console containing a mathematical expression. Write a bool function that checks whether the brackets in the expression () are placed correctly (assume everything else is correct, i.e. you don’t need to check for correct signs, correct variables/numbers, etc.) and returns true if they are correct and false if they are not correct. Print correct or incorrect accordingly on the console
Examples
Input	Output
((a+b)/5-d)	correct
a+b	correct
a+(b)	correct
((a+b)/5-d	incorrect
(a+b	incorrect

========================================================================

Problem 3 – Title Case
Write a program which changes each word in a text to start with a capital letter (don’t bother with the exact title-case rules about not capitalizing things like in, from, etc.). Assume the first letter of a word is an English alphabetical symbol preceded by a non-alphabetical symbol (so in “we will--rock you”, “we”, “will”, “rock” and “you” are all considered words which need to be capitalized). 
Examples
Input	Output
On the south Carpathian mountains,a tree is swinging	On Тhe Сouth Carpathian Мountains,А Тree Is Swinging
Write a program which changes each word in	Write A Program Which Changes Each Word In

========================================================================

Problem 4 – Replace All
Write a program which is given a line of text, another line with a "find" string and another line with a "replace" string. Any part of text which matches the "find" string should be replaced with the "replace" string. Print the resulting text on the console.
Examples
Input	Output
I am the night. Dark Night! No, not the knight
night
day	I am the day. Dark Night! No, not the kday

========================================================================

Problem 5 – Invalid Input
Write a program which reads a line containing integer numbers, separated by spaces, and prints their sum. In addition to the numbers, each line will contain one or more words (sequences of English letters) – print those words on a separate line, separated by spaces, after the sum, in the order they were in the input.
Examples
Input	Output
1 2 3 invalid 4	10
invalid
H 2 adasashd oneTwo -1 4	5
H adasashd oneTwo
0 HELLO 13 -5 ten 10 14 Noise	32
HELLO ten Noise

========================================================================

Problem 6 – The Signal and the Noise
Write a program which reads a sequence of non-negative integer numbers (in the decimal numeral system), separated by spaces, and finds the maximum number. The numbers in the input may have “noise” – symbols before, after, or between the digits of the number, which are not decimal digits (you need to ignore these when reading the numbers). All symbols in the input will be either letters, digits, punctuation, or signs from the standard ASCII table (no control symbols like newlines or tabs, delete, etc.)
Examples
Input	Output	Explanation
5a3 1f a0aaaa f1fg3	53	The numbers are 53 1 0 13, of which 53 is the max
1 2 3	3	The numbers are 1 2 3, of which 3 is the max
1.][.3 5--aA3:)5 2asd=@14	535	The numbers are 13 535 214, of which 535 is the max

========================================================================

Problem 7 – The Noise and the Signal
Same as Problem 6, but your task here is to find the longest noise in a number (numbers will always be positive integers). There are several noises with equal length, print the one that is the first lexicographically. If there are no noises, print “no noise”. All symbols in the input will be either letters, digits, punctuation, or signs from of the standard ASCII table (no control symbols like newlines or tabs, delete, etc.)
Examples
Input	Output	Explanation
5bbbb3 1f a0aaa f1fg3	aaaa	The noises are bbbb f aaaa ffg, aaaa and bbbb are equal length, but aaaa is before bbbb lexicographically
1 2 3	no noise	
1.][.3 5-aA3:)5 2asd=@14	–aA:)	The noises are .][. –aA:) asd=@, of which –aA:) and asd=@ are of equal max length (5), but in the ASCII table, the – sign ("hyphen-minus") is before the letter a, so –aA:) is the first lexicographically
