NOTE – The set method of the Denominator for a given 0 the function should set 1 (you can find it in EXAMPLE 3)
Methods Extern:
Sum, Difference, Multiplication, Division
Example 1
Enter first rational number numerator : 5
Enter first rational number denominator : 2
Enter second rational number numerator : 2
Enter second rational number denominator : 5
Sum  : 29/10
Difference : 21/10
Мultiplication : 10/10
Division : 25/4
Program ended with exit code: 0
Example 2
Enter first rational number numerator : 1
Enter first rational number denominator : 2
Enter second rational number numerator : 2
Enter second rational number denominator : 5
Sum  : 9/10
Difference : 1/10
Мultiplication : 2/10
Division : 5/4
Program ended with exit code: 0
Example 3
Enter first rational number numerator : 10
Enter first rational number denominator : 0
The denominator can't be 0, the denominator will be set to 1
Enter second rational number numerator : 10
Enter second rational number denominator : 0
The denominator can't be 0, the denominator will be set to 1
Sum  : 20/1
Difference : 0/1
