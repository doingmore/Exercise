07. Associative Containers and STL Algorithms 
– Homework Exercises
Write C++ code for solving the tasks on the following pages.
Code should compile under the C++03 or the C++11 standard.
Please submit a single.cpp file for each task.
.cpp files for the tasks should be named with the task number followed by what you feel describes the exercise in a few words.
E.g. a good name for task 2 of this homework would be:
2.odd-occurrences.cpp
Don’t worry about the name too much, just make sure the number and the file extension are correct.

=================================================================

Problem 1 - Count Real Numbers
Read a list of real numbers and print them in ascending order along with their number of occurrences.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output		Input	Output
8 2.5 2.5 8 2.5	2.5 -> 3
8 -> 2		1.5 5 1.5 3	1.5 -> 2
3 -> 1
5 -> 1		-2 0.33 0.33 2	-2 -> 1
0.33 -> 2
2 -> 1

=================================================================

Problem 2 – Odd Occurrences
Write a program that extracts from a given sequence of words all elements that appear in it an odd number of times (case-insensitive).
•	Words are given in a single line, space separated.
•	Print the result elements in lowercase, in their order of appearance.
Examples
Input	Output
Java C# PHP PHP JAVA C java	java, c#, c
3 5 5 hi pi HO Hi 5 ho 3 hi pi	5, hi
a a A SQL xx a xx a A a XX c	a, sql, xx, c

=================================================================

Problem 3 – Largest 3
Read a list of real numbers and print largest 3 of them. If less than 3 numbers exit, print all of them.
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
10 30 15 20 50 5	50 30 20		20 30	30 20

=================================================================

Problem 4 – Short Words
Read a text, extract its words (separated by spaces) find all short words (less than 5 characters) and print them alphabetically, in lowercase, separate by a single comma and a single space
•	Use case-insensitive matching.
•	Remove duplicated words.
Examples
Input	Output
In SoftUni you can study Java C# PHP and JavaScript JAVA and c# developers graduate in 2-3 years Go in	2-3, and, c#, can, go, in, java, php, you

=================================================================

Problem 5 – Sort Numbers
Read a list of decimal numbers and sort them in increasing order. Print the output as shown in the examples below.
Examples
Input	Output
8 2 7 3	2 <= 3 <= 7 <= 8
2 4 -9	-9 <= 2 <= 4

=================================================================

Problem 6 – Squares
Read a list of integers and extract all square numbers from it and print them in descending order. A square number is an integer which is the square of any integer. For example, 1, 4, 9, 16 are square numbers.
Examples
Input	Output
3 16 4 5 6 8 9 	16 9 4
1 9 4 16 8 25 49 16	49 25 16 16 9 4 1

=================================================================

Problem 7 - Miners
You are given a sequence of strings, each on a new line. Every odd line on the console is representing a resource (e.g. Gold, Silver, Copper, and so on), and every even – quantity. Your task is to collect the resources and print them each on a new line. 
Print the resources and their quantities in format:
{resource} –> {quantity}
The quantities inputs will be in the range [1 … 2 000]
Examples
Input	Output		Input	Output
Gold
155
Silver
10
Copper
17
stop	Gold -> 155
Silver -> 10
Copper -> 17		gold
155
silver
10
copper
17
gold
15
stop	gold -> 170
silver -> 10
copper -> 17
