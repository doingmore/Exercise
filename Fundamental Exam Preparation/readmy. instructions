Problem 1 – Sort Array in Descending Order
Write a program, use arrays that for given numbers inputed in the array, sorts them in DESCENDING Order.
WARNING: The numbers should NOT be repeated, the numbers should be ONLY POSITIVE
WARNING: DO NOT USE std::sort !
Example 
Input	Output
5
1 2 3 4 5	5 4 3 2 1
3
190 250 1000	1000 250 190
5
2 6 4 3 7	7 6 4 3 2

==============================================================================

Problem 2 – Sort Array by Order
Write a program, use an array of chars (max char 100), that by inputed characters sorts them in the following order:
•	Numbers
•	Small case letters
•	All others (Caps letters, symbols)
Example 
Input 	Output
5
1 2 3 h H	1 2 3
h
H
3
1 2 X	1 2
X
5
1 2 3 * &	1 2 3
* &

==============================================================================

Problem 3 – Sum of Numbers Above Main Diagonal
Write a program, use vector( Matrix ) that finds the sum of numbers ABOVE the diagonal.
Example 1
Enter size of matrix: 2
Enter matrix[0][0]= 1
Enter matrix[0][1]= 1
Enter matrix[1][0]= 1
Enter matrix[1][1]= 1
The MATRIX is: 
 1 1
 1 1
Sum of numbers аbove diagonal is: 1
Example 2
Enter size of matrix: 3
The MATRIX is: 
 3 3 3
 3 3 3
 3 3 3
Sum of numbers аbove diagonal is: 9
Example 3
Enter size of matrix: 4
The MATRIX is : 
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
 1 2 3 4
Sum of numbers аbove diagonal is: 20

Problem 5 - Area and Perimeter of a Rectangle
Write a program, make a Class Rectangle. For given numbers for the sides, the program should calculate the area and the perimeter of the Rectangle.
Examples
Input	Output
3
4	12
14
1
2	2
6

==============================================================================

Problem 6 – Time Calculation
Write a program, use a class for a given hours:minutes:second the program should calculate the time in
•	hours
•	minutes
•	seconds
Examples
Input	Output
1
1
1	1
61
3661

Problem 7 – Students Information
Write a program, use a class that has params:
•	Student Name
•	Student Surname
•	Total Average 
The class should have Print method that for a given object prints all the information
Make a vector in main that for a given number ( passed thru user ) saves the objects
Examples
Input	Output
2
Maria 
Ivanova 
3.5
Dragan
Ivanov
4.5	Maria Ivanova 3.5
Dragan Ivanov 4.5
Problem 8 – Total Average of Students
Write a program, use a class that has params:
•	Student Name
•	Student Surname
•	Total Average 
The class should have Print method that for a given object prints all the information
Make a vector in main that for a given number ( passed thru user ) saves the objects
Make a function that calculates the Total AVERAGE of ALL students

Explanation:
Number of students – 2 
Name – Maria
Surname – Ivanova
Average – 3.5
Name – Dragan
Surname – Ivanov
Average – 4.5
TOTAL AVERAGE – ( 3.5 + 4.5 ) / 2 = 4
Examples
Input	Output
2
Maria
Ivanova
3.5
Dragan
Ivanov
4.5	Maria Ivanova 3.5
Dragan Ivanov 4.5
4
