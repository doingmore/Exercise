 Welcome! 
This directory is little different, because the tasks from this level 
are with specific instruction. Working with multiple files and skeletons(from SoftUni).
Every task is in different project file. At that file you will discover for every task instruction. 
File with instructions for problems are ".docx", at the general directory for relevant topic.
I went through it the whole course several times. For each period, the solutions to the problems are at different folders.
